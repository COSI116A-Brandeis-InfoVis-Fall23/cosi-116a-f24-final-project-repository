    <h1>Project Team #8: Topic, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Maya Bock</strong>, <strong>Zen Edwards</strong>, <strong>Madeline Gorey</strong>, <strong>Rowan Scassellati</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>From reusing to recycling, when considering the state of the world and how important it is to take care of it, there are many ways in which countries can make a global impact on the harmful effects of climate change. We currently lack a system to easily look at the comparison between renewable energy usage and a country's GDP per capita and electricity access. These comparison points are integral for the understanding of how a country contributes to climate issues and conversely the fight to combat climate change. Understanding the relationship between different countries and highlighting countries which seem to be succeeding and which are struggling allows for decisions to be made based on data driven findings, and give world leaders a better chance to fight this crisis. Creating this visualization aims to give world leaders and interested parties alike the chance to better understand this situation by providing in depth visualizations to give a detailed report of where different countries stand as of 2021, the most recent year data has been collected and published. This depiction should give users the opportunity to get a clear picture on which countries have high amounts of usage of renewable energy, and, when comparing this to GDP per capita and electricity access, which countries stand out, and what trends exist.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

    <p><em> Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.

Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results</em></p>
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Based on the work done by our team through early interviews and research, there were three main tasks that we hoped to be able to address through our visualizations. The first task, and the one that we determined was most important, was: based on countries GDP and electricity access, how does their renewable energy usage compare? This task is best addressed through the scatter plot, allowing users to compare different points, explore different facets about the data, and discover insights. Another task that we determined was critical was: for countries who are expanding their electricity access recently and mainly through renewable energy, are they hitting a plateau in their capability for electricity access? This domain task revolved around the idea that users needed to be able to identify and locate a possible plateau, considering both the relationship between electricity access and renewable energy. This task is addressed through a number of the different views, including the map which allows users to easily distinguish between different regions and analyze possible correlation and trends, while also being able to use the pie chart to notice possible shortfalls depending on the different kinds of renewable energy that are being used by different countries. Our final task was to be able to easily compare a few select countries, allowing users to look up and present differences in countries when considering both their renewable energy and electricity access. This task is addressed through the bar chart, which allows for countries to be selected in other graphs and then are highlighted in a way that is efficient and easily understood by people such that it allows for presentation features from these visualizations as well.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p><em>Our design process emphasizes modularity, interactivity, and data-driven visualizations to deliver meaningful insights into renewable energy distribution and other datasets. We continuously refined our code, adjusting such as changing visualization colors and optimizing data storage to load information asynchronously from a JSON file. We also implemented unique linking approaches, like sending data between files for smoother task transitions. This iterative mindset guided our design choices. For example, using D3.js, we created a map visualization that integrates country-level energy metrics, including renewable energy data, electricity consumption, and GDP, ensuring seamless alignment with geographic features. The pie chart complements this by visualizing energy distribution within selected regions, dynamically updating with CSS conic-gradient for smooth transitions and gradient stops that reflect proportional energy types. Interactivity features, such as hover effects, tooltips, and real-time updates based on selected countries, significantly enhance the user experience. Feedback from usability testing was crucial in refining these visualizations. Users appreciated these interactive elements, which made the data more accessible and engaging. Our bar chart and scatterplot also benefited from iterative improvements and user feedback. The bar chart uses linear and band scales for its axes, updating smoothly with transitions to reflect filtered or user-selected data. Titles and labels were added to improve context, while an update function ensures dynamic responsiveness to new inputs. The scatterplot incorporates linear scales for dimensions like GDP, population, and renewable energy, with visual encodings like color and size to convey categorical and numerical attributes. Interactivity features, including brushing, tooltips, and linked updates across visualizations, allow users to explore data subsets and uncover trends. This cohesive design prioritizes modularity, reusability, and synchronization, ensuring an engaging user experience across all visualizations.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>The project outlines a comprehensive plan for visualizing energy-related data using maps, scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts, each assigned to a specific team member. Madeline's map displays renewable energy percentages by color, Rowan's scatter plot shows renewable energy per capita versus electricity access, Zen's pie chart illustrates types of renewable energy for selected countries, and Maya's bar chart compares statistics between countries. Interactive components include pop-ups with detailed statistics when clicking on a country in the map or scatter plot, while the pie chart updates to show averages for selected countries. The bar chart dynamically updates with country-specific bars alongside a global average. By default, global averages are displayed in the pie and bar charts, allowing users to compare selected countries against these averages. Planned extra features/ areas of improvement include incorporating contextual information, such as regional comparisons or trends over time, to add depth to the analysis and make it more scalable to handle various inputs of large data. These improvements aim to enhance user engagement and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data.</em></p>
